About Me
============
Hi, I'm Luan!

I am currently a [CIMES](https://cimes.princeton.edu/) postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, working with the [FV3](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) team at the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/). 
My current focus is on enhancing FV3's numerical algorithms under the supervision of Dr. [Lucas Harris](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/lucas-harris-homepage/) and Dr. [Joseph Mouallem](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/joseph-mouallem/).

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/) at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Pedro Peixoto](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pedrosp/).

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:ls9640@princeton.edu">ls9640@princeton.edu</a>.

Research Interests
============
My research focuses on the development of numerical methods for partial differential equations, particularly in the context of global atmospheric modeling.
 In particular, I work on finite-volume and finite-difference schemes, the development of spherical computational grids, and strategies to mitigate grid imprinting.

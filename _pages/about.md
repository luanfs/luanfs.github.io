Hi there! I'm Luan Santos, an applied mathematics researcher.

My research focuses on numerical methods for dynamical cores of global atmospheric models, particularly finite-volume and finite-difference schemes, spherical computational grid generation, and mitigation of grid imprinting.

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:ls9640@princeton.edu">ls9640@princeton.edu</a>.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, having started in July 2024, working with the [FV3](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) team at the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/). 
My current focus is on enhancing FV3's numerical algorithms under the supervision of [Lucas Harris](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/lucas-harris-homepage/) and [Joseph Mouallem](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/joseph-mouallem/).

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, earned in May 2024, from the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/) at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br), under the supervision of [Pedro Peixoto](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pedrosp/).

Hi there! I'm Luan Santos, an applied mathematician working on the development and implementation of numerical methods for weather and climate models.

My research is centered on numerical methods for dynamical core development, particularly finite-volume/difference schemes, grid generation algorithms, and grid imprinting mitigation.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, working with the [FV3](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) team at the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/). 
My current focus is on enhancing FV3's numerical algorithms under the supervision of [Lucas Harris](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/lucas-harris-homepage/) and [Joseph Mouallem](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/joseph-mouallem/).

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/) at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br), under the supervision of Dr. [Pedro Peixoto](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pedrosp/).

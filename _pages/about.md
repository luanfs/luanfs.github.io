Hi there! I am Luan Santos, an applied mathematician from São Paulo, Brazil.

------


My research focuses on numerical methods for dynamical core development.
I am mainly interested in finite-volume/difference schemes, grid generation algorithms and also grid imprinting mitigation.

I have a Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/) of the [University of São Paulo](https://www.usp.br).
My advisor was Dr. [Pedro Peixoto](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pedrosp/).

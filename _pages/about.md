Hi there! I am Luan Santos, an applied mathematician from São Paulo, Brazil.

------

I have a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of São Paulo.
My advisor was Dr. [Pedro Peixoto](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pedrosp/).

My research focuses on numerical methods for dynamical core development.
I am mainly interested in finite-volume/difference schemes, grid generation algorithms and also grid imprinting.
